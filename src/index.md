## Home

Hello! I'm **Cylenia**.\
I'm a trans-girl with a passion for **systems administration** and **programming**.\
From **Linux** to **web development**, I love exploring different areas of technology.

Most of my work is pretty silly, but sometimes I make stuff that people might actually use!\
If you have any opportunities for employment I'd love to chat!

I use **NixOS** as my main operating system on both my home server and desktop computer.\
You can find my configuration (as well as this site) publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/cylenia-xd/nixos).

This website is served with **Markdown** using **Eleventy**, and is styled using **CSS**.
