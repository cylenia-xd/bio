      <p>
        I'm Cylenia - a self-proclaimed earthling who has a soft spot for the quiet art of 'putering.
        I like learning how things work, tinkering with ideas, and making sense of the digital world one curious click at a time.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Australia, where I learned pretty early that I’m happiest when I’m taking things apart - digitally, at least - and seeing what
        makes them tick. Most days you’ll find me bouncing between little experiments: a new Linux distro, a half‑finished drawing,
        a program or webapp I’m trying to coax into existence, or some tiny script that solves a problem no one else even has.
        I like the feeling of following a thread of curiosity just to see where it goes, even if it leads somewhere unexpected or
        mildly chaotic. I’m not really chasing perfection, just the fun of making things, breaking things, and learning something along the way.
      </p>
      <h2>Things I'm Into</h2>
      <p>
        I drift toward anything that lets me build, tweak, or shape something: tinkering with Linux, JavaScript side quests,
        web-dev rabbit holes, and the occasional networking puzzle that steals my attention for hours. I love the rhythm of
        designing interfaces, sketching ideas, and turning small thoughts into little digital creations. When I’m not glued
        to a terminal or a canvas, I’m probably thinking about food - especially pizza or burgers, which I’m convinced are
        the true fuel sources of creativity. Mostly, I enjoy having a handful of projects going at once and letting my
        curiosity decide which one gets attention next.
